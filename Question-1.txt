diff b/w String and StringBuilder:-
-----------------------------------------
A string is immutable because to save the memory space

String s1 = "Hello";
String s2 = "Hello";

now if we print

System.out.println(s1 == s2) o/p:- true |because both point to same memory

now suppose if we want to change s1 = "Hello+10";
it is not possible because String is immutable.

So in some we want String to be Mutable.So for that reason we have StringBuilder.

StringBuilder s1 = new StringBuilder("Hello");
StringBuilder s2 = new StringBuilder(""Hello");

Here because of StringBuiler both will have different memory address.

and the Strings are mutable i.e
we can write 

s1.append("10")
the String s1 will be changed

methos of Strings:-
---------------------

s1.length() //5
s1.charAt(2)//l
s1.substring(2)//lo
s1.substring(1,2) //Hlo
s1.indeof(o)  // 4
